@article{Knight2011,
	Abstract = {Nanoantennas are key optical components for
light harvesting; photodiodes convert light into a current of electrons for
photodetection.  We show that these two distinct, independent functions can be
combined into the same structure. Photons coupled into a metallic nanoantenna
excite resonant plasmons, which decay into energetic, "hot" electrons injected
over a potential barrier at the nanoantenna-semiconductor interface, resulting
in a photocurrent. This dual-function structure is a highly compact,
wavelength-resonant, and polarization-specific light detector, with a spectral
response extending to energies well below the semiconductor band edge.},

	Abstract = {Nanoparticle research has become increasingly
important in the context of bioscience and biotechnology. Practical use of
nanoparticles in biology has significantly advanced our understanding about
biological processes in the nanoscale as well as led to many novel diagnostic
and therapeutic applications. Besides, synthetic and natural nanoparticles are
of concern for their potential adverse effect on human health. Development of
novel detection and characterization tools for nanoparticles will impact a broad
range of disciplines in biological research from nanomedicine to nanotoxicology.
In this article, we discuss the recent progress and future directions in the
area of single nanoparticle detectors with an emphasis on their biological
applications. A brief critical overview of electrical and mechanical detection
techniques is given and a more in-depth discussion of label-free optical
detection techniques is presented.},

	Abstract = {Advances in molecular biology, organic
chemistry, and materials science have recently created several new classes of
fluorescent probes for imaging in cell biology. Here we review the
characteristic benefits and limitations of fluorescent probes to study proteins.
The focus is on protein detection in live versus fixed cells: determination of
protein expression, localization, activity state, and the possibility for
combination of fluorescent light microscopy with electron microscopy. Small
organic fluorescent dyes, nanocrystals ("quantum dots"), autofluorescent
proteins, small genetic encoded tags that can be complexed with fluorochromes,
and combinations of these probes are highlighted.},

@article{Manley2014,
	Abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has come of
age and is now prominent among major analytical technologies after the NIR
region was discovered in 1800, revived and developed in the early 1950s and put
into practice in the 1970s. Since its first use in the cereal industry, it has
become the quality control method of choice for many more applications due to
the advancement in instrumentation, computing power and multivariate data
analysis. NIR spectroscopy is also increasingly used during basic research
performed to better understand complex biological systems, e.g. by means of
studying characteristic water absorption bands. The shorter NIR wavelengths
(800-2500 nm), compared to those in the mid-infrared (MIR) range (2500-15â€‰000
nm) enable increased penetration depth and subsequent non-destructive,
non-invasive, chemical-free, rapid analysis possibilities for a wide range of
biological materials. A disadvantage of NIR spectroscopy is its reliance on
reference methods and model development using chemometrics. NIR measurements and
predictions are, however, considered more reproducible than the usually more
accurate and precise reference methods. The advantages of NIR spectroscopy
contribute to it now often being favoured over other spectroscopic (colourimetry
and MIR) and analytical methods, using chemicals and producing chemical waste,
such as gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). This tutorial review intends to provide a brief overview of the basic
theoretical principles and most investigated applications of NIR spectroscopy.
In addition, it considers the recent development, principles and applications of
NIR hyperspectral imaging.  NIR hyperspectral imaging provides NIR spectral data
as a set of images, each representing a narrow wavelength range or spectral
band.  The advantage compared to NIR spectroscopy is that, due to the additional
spatial dimension provided by this technology, the images can be analysed and
visualised as chemical images providing identification as well as localisation
of chemical compounds in non-homogenous samples.},

detecting dipole radiation in a fiber-based confocal microscope of high
numerical aperture. By using a single-mode fiber, in contrast to a hard-stop
pinhole aperture, the detector becomes sensitive to the phase of the field
amplitude. We find that the maximum in collection efficiency of the dipole
radiation does not coincide with the optimum resolution for the light-gathering
instrument. The derived expressions are important for analyzing fiber-based
confocal microscope performance in fluorescence and spectroscopic studies of
single molecules and/or quantum dots.},

@article{Adato2009,
	Abstract = {Infrared absorption spectroscopy enabling direct
access to vibrational fingerprints of the molecular structure is a powerful
method for functional studies of bio-molecules. Although the intrinsic
absorption cross-sections of IR active modes of proteins are nearly 10 orders of
magnitude larger than the corresponding Raman cross-sections, they are still
small compared to that of fluorescence-label based methods. Here, we developed a
new tool based on collective excitation of plasmonic nanoantenna arrays and
demonstrated direct detection of vibrational signatures of single protein
monolayers. We first tailored the geometry of individual nanoantennas to form
resonant structures that match the molecular vibrational modes. The tailored
nanoantennas are then arranged in such a way that their in-phase dipolar
coupling leads to a collective excitation of the ensemble with strongly enhanced
near fields. The combined collective and individual plasmonic responses of the
antenna array play a critical role in attaining signal enhancement factors of
10(4)-10(5). We achieved measurement of the vibrational spectra of proteins at
zeptomole levels for the entire array, corresponding to only 145 molecules per
antenna. The near-field nature of the plasmonic enhancement of the absorption
signals is demonstrated with progressive loading of the nanoantennas with
varying protein film thicknesses. Finally, an advanced model based on
nonequilibrium Green's function formalism is introduced, which explains the
observed Fano-type absorption line-shapes and tuning of the absorption strengths
with the antenna resonance.},

	Abstract = {It is generally accepted that the lifetimes of
the localized plasmonic excitations are inherently controlled by the type of the
metals and the shape of the nanoparticles. However, extended plasmonic lifetimes
and enhanced near-fields in nanoparticle arrays can be achieved as a result of
collective excitation of plasmons. In this article, we demonstrate significantly
longer plasmon lifetimes and stronger near-field enhancements by embedding the
nanoantenna arrays into the substrate. Our approach offers a more homogeneous
dielectric background allowing stronger diffractive couplings among plasmonic
particles leading to strong suppression of the radiative damping. We observe
near-field enhancements well beyond than those achievable with isolated
nanoparticles. Enhanced fields obtained in these structures could be attractive
for biosensing and non-linear photonics applications. (C) 2010 Optical Society

@article{Adato2013,
	Abstract = {Coupled plasmonic resonators have become the
subject of significant research interest in recent years as they provide a route
to dramatically enhanced light-matter interactions. Often, the design of these
coupled mode systems draws intuition and inspiration from analogies to atomic
and molecular physics systems. In particular, they have been shown to mimic
quantum interference effects, such as electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) and Fano resonances. This analogy also been used to describe the
surface-enhanced absorption effect where a plasmonic resonance is coupled to a
weak molecular resonance. These important phenomena are typically described
using simple driven harmonic (or linear) oscillators (i.e., mass-on-a-spring)
coupled to each other. In this work, we demonstrate the importance of an
essential interdependence between the rate at which the system can be driven by
an external field and its damping rate through radiative loss. This link is
required in systems exhibiting time-reversal symmetry and energy conservation.
Not only does it ensure an accurate and physically consistent description of
resonant systems but leads directly to interesting new effects. Significantly,
we demonstrate this dependence to predict a transition between EIT and
electromagnetically induced absorption that is solely a function of the ratio of
the radiative to intrinsic loss rates in coupled resonator systems. Leveraging
the temporal coupled mode theory, we introduce a unique and intuitive picture
that accurately describes these effects in coupled plasmonic/molecular and fully
plasmonic systems. We demonstrate our approach's key features and advantages
analytically as well as experimentally through surface-enhanced absorption
spectroscopy and plasmonic metamaterial applications.},

	Abstract = {Infrared absorption spectroscopy is a powerful
biochemical analysis tool as it extracts detailed molecular structural
information in a label-free fashion. Its molecular specificity renders the
technique sensitive to the subtle conformational changes exhibited by proteins
in response to a variety of stimuli. Yet, sensitivity limitations and the
extremely strong absorption bands of liquid water severely limit infrared
spectroscopy in performing kinetic measurements in biomolecules' native, aqueous
environments. Here we demonstrate a plasmonic chip-based technology that
overcomes these challenges, enabling the in-situ monitoring of protein and
nanoparticle interactions at high sensitivity in real time, even allowing the
observation of minute volumes of water displacement during binding events. Our
approach leverages the plasmonic enhancement of absorption bands in conjunction
with a non-classical form of internal reflection. These features not only expand
the reach of infrared spectroscopy to a new class of biological interactions but
also additionally enable a unique chip-based technology.},

opposing tip-to-tip Au triangles have been fabricated with triangle lengths of
75 nm and gaps ranging from 16 to 488 nm. For light polarized along the line
between the two triangles, the plasmon scattering resonance first blue-shifts
with increasing gap, and then red-shifts as the particles become more and more
uncoupled, while perpendicularly polarized excitation shows little dependence
upon gap size. This behavior may be approximately understood in a coupled-dipole
approximation as changes in the phase between static dipole-dipole interactions
and dipole radiative interaction effects.},

directly related to the wavelength lambda of incident radiation, but this
scaling fails at optical frequencies where metals behave as strongly coupled

wavelength lambda(eff)=n(1)+n(2)lambda/lambda(p), with lambda(p) being the
plasma wavelength and n(1), n(2) being coefficients that depend on geometry and
material properties. It is assumed that the antenna is made of linear segments
with radii R << lambda. Optical antennas hold great promise for increasing the

electronic circuits is now becoming rather limited when digital information
needs to be sent from one point to another. Photonics offers an effective
solution to this problem by implementing optical communication systems based on
optical fibers and photonic circuits. Unfortunately, the micrometer-scale bulky
components of photonics have limited the integration of these components into
electronic chips, which are now measured in nanometers. Surface plasmon-based
circuits, which merge electronics and photonics at the nanoscale, may offer a

	Abstract = {Electromagnetic phased arrays at radio frequencies
are well known and have enabled applications ranging from communications to
radar, broadcasting and astronomy. The ability to generate arbitrary radiation
patterns with large-scale phased arrays has long been pursued. Although it is
extremely expensive and cumbersome to deploy large-scale radiofrequency phased
arrays, optical phased arrays have a unique advantage in that the much shorter
optical wavelength holds promise for large-scale integration. However, the short
optical wavelength also imposes stringent requirements on fabrication. As a
consequence, although optical phased arrays have been studied with various
platforms and recently with chip-scale nanophotonics, all of the demonstrations
so far are restricted to one-dimensional or small-scale two-dimensional arrays.
Here we report the demonstration of a large-scale two-dimensional nanophotonic
phased array (NPA), in which 64 Ã— 64 (4,096) optical nanoantennas are densely
integrated on a silicon chip within a footprint of 576 $\mu$m Ã— 576 $\mu$m with
all of the nanoantennas precisely balanced in power and aligned in phase to
generate a designed, sophisticated radiation pattern in the far field. We also
show that active phase tunability can be realized in the proposed NPA by
demonstrating dynamic beam steering and shaping with an 8 Ã— 8 array. This work
demonstrates that a robust design, together with state-of-the-art complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, allows large-scale NPAs to be implemented
on compact and inexpensive nanophotonic chips. In turn, this enables arbitrary
radiation pattern generation using NPAs and therefore extends the
functionalities of phased arrays beyond conventional beam focusing and steering,
opening up possibilities for large-scale deployment in applications such as
communication, laser detection and ranging, three-dimensional holography and
biomedical sciences, to name just a few.},

we derive an analytical model for the interaction of dipolar transitions with

model includes radiation damping, accurately describes the complete emission

the quantitative evolution of antenna modes, in particular the gradual emergence
of subradiant, super-radiant, and dark modes, as antennas become increasingly
more bound, i.e., plasmonic. Our description is valid for the interaction of
nanorods with light in general and is thus widely applicable.},

	Abstract = {The interaction of light with silver nanoparticle
arrays can in some cases produce mixed plasmonic/photonic bands that have
extremely narrow (<1 meV) line shapes in extinction and scattering. In this
paper we extend computational electrodynamics results of a recent communication
[S. Zou, N. Janel, and G. C. Schatz, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 10871 (2004)] where
this effect was first described to study how these narrow bands are influenced
by a number of structural factors, and to determine how useful these arrays
might be for sensing applications. Included are studies of the effect of
disorder in the array structure on plasmon intensity and width, of the effect of
orientation of the array relative to the polarization and propagation direction
of the incident light, and of the effect of particle shape (comparing results
for silver spheres and cylindrical disks). Our results show that the narrow
    lines are remarkably robust to array disorder, but vacancy defects can
    easily destroy the effect. The narrowest lines are associated with one
    dimensional arrays in which both polarization and wave vectors are
    perpendicular to the array axis. For two dimensional arrays, the narrowest
    lines are associated with the wave vector perpendicular to the plane of the
    array and polarization in the plane. Arrays composed of oblate cylinders
    generate more intense and more redshifted plasmon/photonic peaks than do
    prolate or spherical particles under comparable conditions. Finally, for
    sensing applications in which analyte binding is determined by the plasmon
    wavelength shift associated with change in the surface refractive index, we
    show that the arrays have greater sensitivity than isolated nanoparticles.},

imaging combines the specificity of optical microscopy with the spectral
selectivity of vibrational spectroscopy. There is increasing recognition that
the recorded data may be dependent on the optical configuration and sample
morphology in addition to its local material spectral response, but a
quantitative framework for predicting such dependence is lacking. Here, a theory
is developed to relate recorded data to the spectral and physical properties of
heterogeneous samples. The modeling approach combines optical theory through
rigorous coupled wave analysis with modeling of sampling geometry and sample
structure. The interplay of morphology and dispersion are systematically
explored using increasingly sophisticated samples to illustrate the dependence
of the detected optical intensity on the spatial sample structure. Predictions
of spectral distortions arising from the sample structure are quantified, and
experimental validation of the developed theory is performed using a
microfabricated standard from a commercial photoresist polymer. The developed
framework forms a basis for understanding sample induced distortions in
spectroscopic IR microscopy and imaging.},

	Abstract = {In the present Letter, we demonstrate how
the design of metallic nanoparticle arrays with large electric field enhancement
can be performed using the basic paradigm of engineering, namely the
optimization of a well-defined objective function. Such optimization is carried
out by coupling a genetic algorithm with the analytical multiparticle Mie
theory. General design criteria for best enhancement of electric fields are
obtained, unveiling the fundamental interplay between the near-field plasmonic
and radiative photonic coupling. Our optimization approach is experimentally
validated by surface-enhanced Raman scattering measurements, which demonstrate
how genetically optimized arrays, fabricated using electron beam lithography,
lead to order of ten improvement of Raman enhancement over nanoparticle dimer

@article{Liberman2012,
	Abstract = {We present an approach for rational design
and optimization of plasmonic arrays for ultrasensitive surface enhanced
infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy of specific protein analytes. Motivated
by our previous work that demonstrated sub-attomole detection of surface-bound
silk fibroin [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 19227 (2009)], we introduce
here a general framework that allows for the numerical optimization of
metamaterial sensor designs in order to maximize the absorbance signal. A
critical feature of our method is the explicit compensation for the perturbative
effects of the analyte's refractive index which alters the resonance frequency
and line-shape of the metamaterial response, thereby leading to spectral
distortion in SEIRA signatures. As an example, we leverage our method to
optimize the geometry of periodic arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles on both Si
and CaF2 substrates. The optimal geometries result in a three-order of magnitude
absorbance enhancement compared to an unstructured Au layer, with the CaF2
substrate offering an additional factor of three enhancement in absorbance over
a traditional Si substrate. The latter improvement arises from increase of
near-field intensity over the Au nanobar surface for the lower index substrate.
Finally, we perform sensitivity analysis for our optimized arrays to predict the
effects of fabrication imperfections. We find that <20\% deviation from the
optimized absorbance response is readily achievable over large areas with modern
nanofabrication techniques.},

	Abstract = {A rigorous coupled-wave approach is used to
analyze diffraction by general planar gratings bounded by two different media.
The grating fringes may have any orientation (slanted or unslanted) with respect
to the grating surfaces. The analysis is based on a state-variables
representation and results in a unifying, easily computer-implementable matrix
formulation of the general planar-grating diffraction problem. Accurate
diffraction characteristics are presented for the first time to the authors'
knowledge for general slanted gratings. This present rigorous formulation is
compared with rigorous modal theory, approximate two-wave modal theory,
approximate multiwave coupled-wave theory, and approximate two-wave coupled-wave
theory. Typical errors in the diffraction characteristics introduced by these
various approximate theories are evaluated for transmission, slanted, and
reflection gratings. Inclusion of higher-order waves in a theory is important
for obtaining accurate predictions when forward-diffracted orders are dominant
(transmission-grating behavior). Conversely, when backward-diffracted orders
dominate (reflection-grating behavior), second derivatives of the field
amplitudes and boundary diffraction need to be included to produce accurate
results.},

	Abstract = {Metamaterials are artificially structured media
with unit cells much smaller than the wavelength of light. They have proved to
possess novel electromagnetic properties, such as negative magnetic permeability
and negative refractive index. This enables applications such as negative
refraction, superlensing and invisibility cloaking. Although the physical
properties can already be demonstrated in two-dimensional (2D) metamaterials,
the practical applications require 3D bulk-like structures. This prerequisite
has been achieved in the gigahertz range for microwave applications owing to the
ease of fabrication by simply stacking printed circuit boards. In the optical
domain, such an elegant method has been the missing building block towards the
realization of 3D metamaterials. Here, we present a general method to
manufacture 3D optical (infrared) metamaterials using a layer-by-layer
technique. Specifically, we introduce a fabrication process involving
planarization, lateral alignment and stacking. We demonstrate stacked
metamaterials, investigate the interaction between adjacent stacked layers and
analyse the optical properties of stacked metamaterials with respect to an
increasing number of layers.},

	Abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based
sensing has found wide applications in medical diagnosis, food safety regulation
and environmental monitoring. Compared with commercial propagating surface
plasmon resonance (PSPR)-based sensors, LSPR ones are simple, cost-effective and
suitable for measuring local refractive index changes. However, the figure of
merit (FOM) values of LSPR sensors are generally 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller
than those of PSPR ones, preventing the widespread use of LSPR sensors. Here we
describe an array of submicrometer gold mushrooms with a FOM reaching \~{}108,
which is comparable to the theoretically predicted upper limit for standard PSPR
sensors. Such a high FOM arises from the interference between Wood's anomaly and
the LSPRs. We further demonstrate the array as a biosensor for detecting
cytochrome c and alpha-fetoprotein, with their detection limits down to 200â€‰pM
and 15â€‰ngâ€‰ml(-1), respectively, suggesting that the array is a promising
candidate for label-free biomedical sensing.},

reducing the medium's microstructure to a fixed-length string of binary digits.
These physical one-way functions are inexpensive to fabricate, prohibitively
difficult to duplicate, admit no compact mathematical representation, and are
